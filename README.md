Please read my Bitmap Naming System theory at the above address to understand they why and how of this code repository.

 This repository is broken up into 3 branches. This main branch is how I started. It is the code i set up to run a bitmap indexer, prior to any implementation of the ordinals rust code into integration. 

 Intergration is the code and setup on how we would go about adding the Bitmap Indexer to the ord client as integrated code. A soft fork of ORD if you will, that adds bitmap and BNS registry as an optional field for anyone to activate in their ORD client. It would not be a required addition to any node operator's database, but would be integrated to allow for the robust addition that the bitmapping address system offers. Let's recreate the free DNS like it was meant to be Baby!
